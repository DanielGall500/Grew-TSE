Metrics
=======
A collection of metrics that aim to help discern model performance in Targeted Syntactic Evaluation.
Many of these are available through the GrewTSEvaluator and will automatically be calculated when called after providing a Minimal-Pair Dataset.
Alternatively, you may use them freely through this module.
